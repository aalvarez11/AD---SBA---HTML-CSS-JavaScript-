### Implementation
#### Index

The initial page of the site is index.html, this is the 'home' and first thing someone visiting the site should see. The page welcomes visitors and gives them a quick view of the gardens available using a bootstrap carousel. There is also a nav bar with pills (also from bootstrap) that shows visitors what other pages they can look at; This navbar will appear throughout the entire site.

#### Register

The registration page for incoming members to sign up. There is a registration form shown asking for the potential member's email and a password. validation is put in validate.js to check the password (using regex) for a lowercase letter, uppercase letter, and a number. There is also another check for the repeated password to match the initial password, all being listened to by the register submission button. A dropdown is also included which would check for the user's selection to prove they are not a robot (unfortunately this is not implemented).
